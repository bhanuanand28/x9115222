### Running Instructions 

###Abstract
We compare statistics generated via Scott-Knott to decide which of DE, MWS and SA work best to optimize DTLZ 7 with 2 objectives 
and 10 decisions. To generate these statistics , we use the Loss number generated between the last and the first generation of 
each optimiser . We calculate this loss number 20 times for each optimizer and used the array hence generated and inputted them 
to the Scott Knott statistic generation program . We found that DE works best for optimisation then SA and then MWS .

###Objective
To compare which out of DE, MWS and SA optimises DTLZ7 with 2 objectives and 10 decisions the best . 

###Type 1 , Type 2 , Type 3 Operators
When we are comparing the functioning of two optimisers , we utilise three comparison operators : 
  1.  *Type 1 operator*: This operator is used to decide which amongst two candidates generates a better solution for DTLZ 7 . The 
       DTLZ 7 has 2 objectives and we need to compare if a candidate is better than a second candidtae on both these objectives. The 
       Type 1 operator should take the minimum time to compute . 
  2.   *Type 2 operator* : This operator is used to decide whether ir not there is a significant improvement between two eras generated
        by an optimizer. It is used for early termination as well . If there is significant improvement we continue on with the next
        generation, else we terminate the current generation . 
  3.   *Type 3 operator*: This operator is used to decide which of the three optimizers is best for the given problem being optimized. 

###Implementation 
We applied the Type 1 and Type 2 operators to our code for SA, MWS and DE and compared the loss values between consequent generations
20 times. These values were then compared using Type 3 statistical machinery via Scott Knott and graphs were generated. Thsi is how 
these three operatore were applied : 
1.  *Type 1 operator* : This was used to compare two candidates generated and decide which one was better . This was done in the inner
       most loop of each optimisers . To compare two candidates we computed the objectives generated for each candidate and aggregated
       them by a simple summation . Since The Type 1 operator should take minimum time to run and also since for DTLZ 7 the objectives 
       do not conflict , doing a summation seemed to be ok .
2.  *Type 2 operator*: This was used to compare if the set of candidates generation in an era weer better than the candidates generated
       in the era before. To do this comparison , we used the a12 test and find the loss between the array of values generated in each 
       era with the array of values generate in its consequent era . This was used to apply early termination to the optimizer. We 
       compared the loss values generated to 0.56 .(quoting STATS :  According to Vargha and Delaney, a small difference between two
       populations is:when the a12 value is 56% or less ) . Hence if we found that the loss value was over 0.56 then we increased the 
       number of iterations by 5 . If not , we reduce them by 1 . A difference of more than 0.56 between two populations means that 
       there is significant change from one population to the next.  
3.  *Type 3 operator*: This is to compare the final eras generated by different optimizers . For this we found the loss values from 
       Type 2 operator in 2. 20 times for each optimiser and store this in a list. This list hence contained 20 loss values . We then
       compared the lists generated for the three optimisers by passing it to rdivdemo which genreated Scott knott graphs and the 
       median , the inter quartile range and the 25 %ile , 50 %ile amd 70 % ile values . 

###Results
It can be observed from the graphs that DE works best on DTLZ 7 with 2 objectives followeed by SA, followed by MWS . In the graph we can 
observe that Inter Quartile Range for DE is the best . This means that since the rdivdemo was run on loss values between inital and 
final era , This sugests that DE produces the maximum difference between the first and last era. The loss improves from  0.85 to 1.00 
between the 25th and the 75th quartile , which shows that DE produces diverse results . 


###Threats to Validity 
1. We ran the code only for 20 iterations . Running the code for a larger number of iterations may produce better statitics. 
2. We used the loss value between generations to compute the graph . We could have used hypervolume or any other machinery to do this 
comparison as well and based our results on the aggreagation of those results . 
3. We used weights 1 for both objectives in the aggegation function . This could be evaluated with some other weights assigned 
as well. 
4. The inner loop in each optimiser was run just 1000 times , This could have been run more number of times . 
5. The value of 0.56 seemed to be large . 


###Future Work 
1. The code could be run for more number of iterations. 
2. We could use hypervolume etc to generate more than 1 graph and affirm the results across these graphs . 
3. The inner loop could be run more than 1000 times . 
4. The weights could have been assigned by inputting the weights to an optimiser and deciding which produces best optimisation and 
tuning our optimizer based on that . 
5. We could use the value of 0.56 and tune our optimiser to that. 
6. We could tun this for other optimisers like GA and see where DE stands in comparison.
